        Make an attack with one of your weapons against a target within range.
    </p>

    <h5>Melee</h5>
    <p>
        You roll your weapon's damage dice, exploding. This is your attack score. The target then chooses one of the following ways to generate their defense score.
    </p>

    <h6>Parry</h6>
    <p>
        The target chooses one of their weapons to parry your attack with. The target rolls that weapon's damage dice. This is the target's defense score. If the target's defense score is less than your attack score, the target is dealt damage equal to the difference. If the target's defense score is greater than your attack score, you are dealt damage equal to the difference.
    </p>

    <h6>Dodge</h6>
    <p>
        If the attack is an attack of opportunity, the target must choose this reaction. If not, the target must be able to use the Move action to choose this reaction.
    </p>
    <p>
        The target's defense score is equal to their Agility. If the target's defense score is less than your attack score, the target is dealt damage equal to the difference. If the attack was not an attack of opportunity, the target must then use the Move action. It may do so without provoking an attack of opportunity from you.
    </p>

    <h6>Block</h6>
    <p>
        The target chooses one of their shields to block your attack with. Your attack score is dealt as damage to that shield.
    </p>

    <h5>Ranged</h5>
    <p>
        You roll your weapon's damage dice, exploding. This is your attack score. Reduce your attack score based on the distance between you and your target and your weapon's ranges.
