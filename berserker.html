<h2>Berserk</h2>
<p>
You may pay 1 point of sanity to go berserk. While berserking, all damage dealt in melee is doubled, and all wounds penalties are halved. You stop berserking if you do not make a melee attack during your turn, or you suffer 2/3/4/5/6 wounds. You then gain 5/4/3/2/1 levels of exhaustion, reduced by 1 at the start of each of your turns.
